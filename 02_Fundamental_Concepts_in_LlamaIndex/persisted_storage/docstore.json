Its purpose is to bring men\r\ncourage and resolution, to cheer them, to fire them with new confidence\r\nwhen they grow dispirited, to strengthen their faith that THINGS CAN BE\r\nDONE. It is better for this purpose than the entire works of any one\r\npoet, for it takes the cream of many and has greater diversity than any\r\none writer can show.\r\n\r\nIt is made up chiefly of very recent poems--not such as were written for\r\nanthologies of poetical \"gems,\" but such as speak directly to the heart,\r\nalways in very simple language, often in the phrases of shop or office\r\nor street. Included, however, with the poems of the day are a few of the\r\nfine old pieces that have been of comfort to men through the ages.\r\n\r\nBesides the poems themselves, the volume contains helps to their\r\nunderstanding and enjoyment. The pieces are introduced by short\r\ncomments; these serve the same purpose as the strain played by the\r\npianist before the singer begins to sing; they create a mood, give a\r\npoint of view, throw light on the meaning of what follows.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2092, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c6376834-d224-4e1c-ab75-3c88f98fb9c4": {"__data__": {"id_": "c6376834-d224-4e1c-ab75-3c88f98fb9c4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "data/pg10763.txt", "file_name": "pg10763.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 405159, "creation_date": "2024-05-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-05"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "data/pg10763.txt", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/pg10763.txt", "file_name": "pg10763.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 405159, "creation_date": "2024-05-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-05"}, "hash": "3a09d926c0f4a5992512ad09ec9fe982a5d94ec4871bb096d8c37e61a6aa1589", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ef9207bd-7cd8-44c9-98e2-74c7545c9954", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/pg10763.txt", "file_name": "pg10763.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 405159, "creation_date": "2024-05-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-05"}, "hash": "4eb4a280d0f7618a8d30a60db33a6f0586d61e1bf053f8b38d0433b5024abdc6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "0de9bc82-9152-4d12-b059-0b012f1b2f4c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e3b74a7caa35b9abae6219b04427ebdca3103735c33999cdf516a3bf2d0b4bb1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Also the\r\nlives of the authors are briefly summarized; this is in answer to our\r\nnatural interest in the writer of a poem we like, and in the case of\r\nliving poets it brings together facts hardly to be found anywhere else.\r\n\r\nFinally, the book is not one to be read and then cast aside. It is to be\r\nkept as a constant companion and an unfailing recourse in weariness or\r\ngloom. Human companions are not always in the mood to cheer us, and may\r\ntalk upon themes we dislike. But this book will converse or be silent,\r\nit is never out of sorts or discouraged, and so far from being wed to\r\nsome single topic, it will speak to us at any time on any subject we\r\ndesire.\r\n\r\nTo many authors and publishers acknowledgment is due for generous\r\npermission to use copyright material.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nAbou Ben Adhem............................. _Leigh Hunt_\r\nAnswer, The................................ _Grantland Rice_\r\nAppreciation............................... _William Judson Kibby_\r\nArrow and the Song, The.................... _Henry Wadsworth Longfellow_\r\nAwareness.................................. _Miriam Teichner_\r\n\r\nBars of Fate, The.......................... _Ellen M.H.

To cross on broken ice,\r\nas Eliza did to freedom, or to row amid floating ice, as Washington did\r\nto victory, is harder still. This poem applies especially to those who\r\nare discouraged in a struggle to which they are already committed.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Everything's easy after it's done;\r\n  Every battle's a \"cinch\" that's won;\r\n  Every problem is clear that's solved--\r\n  The earth was round when it _revolved!_\r\n  But Washington stood amid grave doubt\r\n  With enemy forces camped about;\r\n  He could not know how he would fare\r\n  Till _after_ he'd crossed the Delaware.\r\n\r\n  Though the river was full of ice\r\n  He did not think about it twice,\r\n  But started across in the dead of night,\r\n  The enemy waiting to open the fight.\r\n  Likely feeling pretty blue,\r\n  Being human, same as you,\r\n  But he was brave amid despair,\r\n  And Washington crossed the Delaware!\r\n\r\n  So when you're with trouble beset,\r\n  And your spirits are soaking wet,\r\n  When all the sky with clouds is black,\r\n  Don't lie down upon your back\r\n  And look at _them_. Just do the thing;\r\n  Though you are choked, still try to sing.\r\n  If times are dark, believe them fair,\r\n  And you will cross the Delaware!\r\n\r\n\r\n_Joseph Morris._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRABBI BEN EZRA\r\n\r\n(SELECTED VERSES)\r\n\r\n\r\nTo some people success is everything, and the easier it is gained the\r\nbetter.", "start_char_idx": 46264, "end_char_idx": 48257, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1b014a34-fa08-4b0c-8ce7-e180cc57360a": {"__data__": {"id_": "1b014a34-fa08-4b0c-8ce7-e180cc57360a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "data/pg10763.txt", "file_name": "pg10763.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 405159, "creation_date": "2024-05-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-05"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "data/pg10763.txt", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/pg10763.txt", "file_name": "pg10763.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 405159, "creation_date": "2024-05-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-05"}, "hash": "3a09d926c0f4a5992512ad09ec9fe982a5d94ec4871bb096d8c37e61a6aa1589", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e8e243c0-a475-45f7-a5a0-790386a27a2b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/pg10763.txt", "file_name": "pg10763.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 405159, "creation_date": "2024-05-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-05"}, "hash": "a93db89b90b70c6c1c98b6f70a7f388688c584bea231a3c859bc7837d4e78533", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "8aa7bcbe-a4c2-4144-ae48-94c11667ab38", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "470deddc4a3658610fabbc9f22ae67d167518f1e36d0a339744dd41bc91c6e37", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "To Browning success is nothing unless it is won by painful\r\neffort.

The poet, looking upon the now empty\r\nshell, thinks of human life as growing in the same way.

A frequent error in quoting it is the substitution of the word\r\n_well_ for _right_. Browning is no such shallow optimist as to believe\r\nthat all is well with the world, but he does maintain that things are\r\nright with the world, for in spite of its present evils it is slowly\r\nworking its way toward perfection, and in the great scheme of things it\r\nmay make these evils themselves an instrument to move it toward its\r\nultimate goal.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The year's at the spring\r\n  And day's at the morn;\r\n  Morning's at seven;\r\n  The hillside's dew-pearled;\r\n  The lark's on the wing;\r\n  The snail's on the thorn;\r\n  God's in his heaven--\r\n  All's right with the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Robert Browning._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOWNERSHIP\r\n\r\n\r\nThe true value of anything lies, not in the object itself or in its\r\nlegal possession, but in our attitude to it. We may own a thing in fee\r\nsimple, yet derive from it nothing but vexation. For those who have\r\nlittle, as indeed for those who have much, there are no surer means of\r\nhappiness than enjoying that which they do not possess.

It is shot through and through with the spirit\r\nof strenuous and never-ceasing endeavor--a spirit manifest in a hero who\r\nhas every temptation to rest and enjoy. Ulysses is old. After ten long\r\nyears of warfare before Troy, after endless misfortunes on his homeward\r\nvoyage, after travels and experiences that have taken him everywhere and\r\nshown him everything that men know and do, he has returned to his rude\r\nnative kingdom.

I've\r\n  just been reading of a gent who joined the has-been ranks, at\r\n  fifty years without a cent, or credit at the banks. But\r\n  undismayed he buckled down, refusing to be beat, and captured\r\n  fortune and renown; he's now on Easy Street. Men say that\r\n  fellows down and out ne'er leave the rocky track, but facts\r\n  will show, beyond a doubt, that has-beens do come back. I know,\r\n  for I who write this rhyme, when forty-odd years old, was down\r\n  and out, without a dime, my whiskers full of mold. By black\r\n  disaster I was trounced until it jarred my spine; I was a\r\n  failure so pronounced I didn't need a sign. And after I had\r\n  soaked my coat, I said (at forty-three), \"I'll see if I can\r\n  catch the goat that has escaped from me.\" I labored hard; I\r\n  strained my dome, to do my daily grind, until in triumph I came\r\n  home, my billy-goat behind. And any man who still has health\r\n  may with the winners stack, and have a chance at fame and\r\n  wealth--for has-beens do come back.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Walt Mason._\r\n\r\nFrom \"Walt Mason, His Book.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWISHING\r\n\r\n\r\nHorace Greeley said that no one need fear the editor who indulged in\r\ndiatribes against the prevalence of polygamy in Utah, but that\r\nmalefactors had better look out when an editor took up his pen against\r\nabuses in his own city.", "start_char_idx": 138832, "end_char_idx": 140662, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0fd7b124-6687-4eb9-be9b-3008dab3319a": {"__data__": {"id_": "0fd7b124-6687-4eb9-be9b-3008dab3319a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "data/pg10763.txt", "file_name": "pg10763.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 405159, "creation_date": "2024-05-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-05"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "data/pg10763.txt", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/pg10763.txt", "file_name": "pg10763.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 405159, "creation_date": "2024-05-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-05"}, "hash": "3a09d926c0f4a5992512ad09ec9fe982a5d94ec4871bb096d8c37e61a6aa1589", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "2810192b-22cd-4f97-8c12-3a9dfe34d17c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/pg10763.txt", "file_name": "pg10763.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 405159, "creation_date": "2024-05-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-05"}, "hash": "44fb9d2b44ca15fe39ee9485de186ba6ac92baebd296dde0065f75612e7420a0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "51457bfd-ffc3-4c83-855f-706eb662a1ff", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "5ff62fd13f2561c400f457584b3fbad7c95d4bdcffb71986dddbc66d537990f6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "We all tend to begin our reforms too far away\r\nfrom home.

To seek petty, immediate\r\ntriumphs instead of earning and waiting for the big, silent approval of\r\none's own conscience and of those who understand, is a mark of\r\ninferiority.

The Foundation\u2019s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.

Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.

Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg\u2122 concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg\u2122 eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\u2122 eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg\u2122,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.", "start_char_idx": 403252, "end_char_idx": 404950, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}",

    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we'll explore what chunking is, how it affects the indexing and retrieval process, and how you can customize chunk size and overlap to optimize your results.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **The Chunking Commandment:** Your goal is not to chunk for chunking sake, our goal is to get our data in a format where it can be retrieved for value later.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> -- Greg Kamradt, [5 Levels Of Text Splitting](https://github.com/FullStackRetrieval-com/RetrievalTutorials/blob/main/tutorials/LevelsOfTextSplitting/5_Levels_Of_Text_Splitting.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Understanding Chunking\n",
    "\n",
    "When documents are ingested into an index, `LlamaIndex` splits them into smaller pieces called \"chunks.\"  This process is known as chunking. By default, LlamaIndex uses a *chunk size* of 1024 and a *chunk overlap* of 20. \n",
    "\n",
    "But what do these numbers mean, and how do they impact the indexing and retrieval process?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Chunk Size\n",
    "\n",
    "The chunk size determines the maximum number of tokens (roughly equivalent to words) that each chunk will contain. With a default chunk size of 1024, `LlamaIndex` will split your documents into chunks that are no longer than 1024 tokens each.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **🤏 Smaller Chunk Size**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   More precise and focused embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Beneficial for retrieving specific information\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **👐Larger Chunk Size**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   More general embeddings with broader context\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Useful for document overviews, but may miss details\n",
    "\n",
    "### Chunk Overlap\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Shared tokens between adjacent chunks (default: 20)\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Maintains context and prevents information loss\n",
    "\n",
    "I recommend taking a look at [this chunk visualizer](https://huggingface.co/spaces/m-ric/chunk_visualizer) to get an intuitive sense for chunk size and overlap.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🤔 The Impact of Chunk Size\n",
    " \n",
    "I recommend reading [this blog](https://www.llamaindex.ai/blog/evaluating-the-ideal-chunk-size-for-a-rag-system-using-llamaindex-6207e5d3fec5) post by the LlamaIndex team.\n",
    "\n",
    " #### **📏 Relevance and Granularity**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Smaller chunks (e.g., 128) offer granularity but risk missing vital information, or lack sufficient context.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Larger chunks (e.g., 512) are more likely to capture necessary context, but also run the risk of including irrelevant information.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Faithfulness and Relevancy metrics help assess response quality. \n",
    "\n",
    " #### **🎯 Chunk Size and Use Case**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Question Answering:** Shorter, specific chunks for precise answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Summarization:** Longer chunks to capture the overall context.\n",
    "\n",
    " #### **⏳ Response Generation Time**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Larger chunks provide more context but may slow down the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Balancing comprehensiveness with speed is crucial.\n",
    "    \n",
    " #### **⚖️ Finding the Optimal Size**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Testing various chunk sizes is essential for specific use cases and datasets. \n",
    "\n",
    "*   Balancing information capture with efficiency is key.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Considerations When Customizing Chunk Size\n",
    "\n",
    "When deciding on a chunk size, there are a few things to keep in mind:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Factor | Description |\n",
    "|--------|-------------|\n",
    "| 📄 **Data Characteristics** | The optimal chunk size depends on the data you're indexing. Long, detailed documents, may require a larger chunk size to capture more context. Smaller chunk size may be more appropriate for short, focused passages. |\n",
    "| 🔍 **Retrieval Requirements** | If you need to retrieve very specific details, a smaller chunk size may be better. If you're looking for more general information, a larger chunk size may suffice. |\n",
    "| 🔢 **Similarity Parameters** | With a smaller chunk size, the embeddings become more specific, and as a result, there might be more relevant chunks that match a given query. To accommodate this increase in potentially relevant chunks, it is advisable to increase the `similarity_top_k` parameter. This adjustment ensures that the query engine does not overlook relevant results due to a too narrow top-k selection. |\n",
    "\n",
    "### There are [various methods](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/module_guides/loading/node_parsers/modules) you can use to chunk your documents. \n",
    "\n",
    "| Parser Type | Splitter Name | Description |\n",
    "|-------------|---------------|-------------|\n",
    "| 📁 File-Based Node Parsers | 📄`SimpleFileNodeParser` | The simplest flow: `FlatFileReader` + `SimpleFileNodeParser` which automatically use the best node parser for each type of content. Then, you may want to chain the file-based node parser with a text-based node parser to account for the actual length of the text. |\n",
    "| | 🌐`HTMLNodeParser` | This node parser uses beautifulsoup to parse raw HTML. By default, it will parse a select subset of HTML tags, but you can override this. The default tags are: [\"p\", \"h1\", \"h2\", \"h3\", \"h4\", \"h5\", \"h6\", \"li\", \"b\", \"i\", \"u\", \"section\"] |\n",
    "| | 🎭`JSONNodeParser` | The `JSONNodeParser` parses raw JSON. |\n",
    "| | 📝`MarkdownNodeParser` | The `MarkdownNodeParser` parses raw markdown text. |\n",
    "| ✂️ Text-Splitters | 💻`CodeSplitter` | Splits raw code-text based on the language it is written in. |\n",
    "| | 🦜🔗`LangchainNodeParser` | You can also wrap any existing text splitter from langchain with a node parser. |\n",
    "| | 📜`SentenceSplitter` | The `SentenceSplitter` attempts to split text while respecting the boundaries of sentences. |\n",
    "| | 🪟`SentenceWindowNodeParser` | The `SentenceWindowNodeParser` splits all documents into individual sentences. The resulting nodes also contain the surrounding \"window\" of sentences around each node in the metadata.|\n",
    "| | 🧠`SemanticSplitterNodeParser` | Instead of chunking text with a fixed chunk size, the semantic splitter adaptively picks the breakpoint in-between sentences using embedding similarity. This ensures that a \"chunk\" contains sentences that are semantically related to each other. |\n",
    "| | 🪙`TokenTextSplitter` | The `TokenTextSplitter` attempts to split to a consistent chunk size according to raw token counts. |\n",
    "| 🔗 Relation-Based Node Parsers | 🌿`HierarchicalNodeParser` | This node parser will chunk nodes into hierarchical nodes. This means a single input will be chunked into several hierarchies of chunk sizes, with each node containing a reference to it's parent node. |\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "The primary function is to divide a given text into smaller chunks, ensuring each chunk stays within a specified token limit. \n",
    "\n",
    "### **How it Works**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Tokenization:** It utilizes a tokenizer to break down the text into individual tokens (words or subwords).  The default tokenizer is the `tiktoken` tokenizer for GPT-3.5-Turbo.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Chunking:** It then groups these tokens into chunks, ensuring each chunk's size is within the defined `chunk_size` limit. \n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Overlap Handling:** To maintain context and coherence between chunks, it can incorporate an overlap, specified by `chunk_overlap`, where the last few tokens of one chunk are repeated at the beginning of the next.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Arguments you need to know\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **`chunk_size`**: Controls the maximum token count for each chunk. Defualts to 1024.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **`chunk_overlap`**: Determines the number of overlapping tokens between consecutive chunks. Defaults to 20.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **`separator`**: Specifies the primary character used to split the text into words. Defaults to space (`\" \"`). \n",
    "\n",
    "*   **`backup_separators`**: Provides additional characters for splitting if the primary separator isn't sufficient. Defaults to new line character (`\"\\n\"`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: The order of splitting is: 1. split by separator, 2. split by backup separators (if any), 3. split by characters\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **`include_metadata`**: Enables or disables the inclusion of metadata within each chunk. Defaults to `True`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`include_prev_next_rel`**: Enables or disables tracking the relationship between nodes. Defaults to `True`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Usage Example\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic usage pattern is as follows (you don't need to pass anything if you want to keep the default values.):\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from llama_index.core.node_parser import TokenTextSplitter\n",
    "\n",
    "splitter = TokenTextSplitter()\n",
    "\n",
    "nodes = splitter.get_nodes_from_documents(documents)\n",
    "```\n",
    "I'll limit our exploration to the `chunk_sizes = [64, 128, 256, 512]` and hold `chunk_overlap` fixed to 16 tokens. "

    "# [📜`SentenceSplitter`](https://github.com/run-llama/llama_index/blob/main/llama-index-core/llama_index/core/node_parser/text/sentence.py)\n",
    "\n",
    "The `SentenceSplitter` class, as its name suggests, specializes in splitting text while trying to keep complete sentences and paragraphs together. This is in contrast to the `TokenTextSplitter`, which focuses on token limits.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How it Works\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initial Splitting**\n",
    "\n",
    "    *   The text is first divided into paragraphs using the specified `paragraph_separator` (defaults to triple newline characters `\"\\n\\n\\n\"`).\n",
    "\n",
    "    *   Each paragraph is then further split using a \"chunking tokenizer\" (defaults to [`PunktSentenceTokenizer`](https://www.nltk.org/api/nltk.tokenize.PunktSentenceTokenizer.html) from the `nltk` library). Which basically looks for sentences boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "    *   If these methods don't yield enough splits, it resorts to a backup regex and the default separators (`CHUNKING_REGEX = \"[^,.;。？！]+[,.;。？！]?\"`).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Chunking with Sentence Awareness**\n",
    "\n",
    "    *   The resulting splits are grouped into chunks, keeping sentences together as much as possible. \n",
    "\n",
    "    *   It considers the `is_sentence` flag for each split during this process.\n",
    "\n",
    "    *   Chunk size and overlap still play a role, but sentence boundaries are given preference.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Overlap Handling**\n",
    "\n",
    "    *   Similar to `TokenTextSplitter`, it incorporates overlap between chunks to maintain context. \n",
    "\n",
    "    *   However, it prioritizes using the last complete sentence for overlap rather than just the last few tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Arguments you need to know\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **`chunk_size`**: The target token size for each chunk.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **`chunk_overlap`**: The number of overlapping tokens between chunks.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **`separator`**: The default separator for splitting (e.g., space).\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **`paragraph_separator`**: The string used to identify paragraph breaks.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **`secondary_chunking_regex`**: A backup regex for splitting if the primary methods are insufficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Usage Example\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from llama_index.core.node_parser import SentenceSplitter\n",
    "\n",
    "splitter = SentenceSplitter(chunk_size=256, chunk_overlap=50)\n",
    "\n",
    "nodes = splitter.get_nodes_from_documents(documents)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use SentenceSplitter\n",
    "\n",
    "*   When preserving complete sentences and paragraphs is essential for understanding the context.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   When dealing with text where sentence boundaries are meaningful (e.g., legal documents, narratives).\n",
    "\n",
    "*   When you want to avoid having broken sentences at the beginning or end of chunks."

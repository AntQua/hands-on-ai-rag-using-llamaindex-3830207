Well, their luck just became your luck, because they’re going  to come to you to get to the treasure, and you’re going to get  paid for it. This is an extreme example, but it shows how one person had  blind luck finding the treasure. Them coming to you to extract  it and give you half is not blind luck. You created your own luck.  You put yourself in a position to capitalize on luck or to attract  luck when nobody else created the opportunity for themselves.  To get rich without getting lucky, we want to be deterministic.

You don’t want to be wealthy in the fifty of them where  you got lucky, so we want to factor luck out of it. But getting lucky would help, right? Just recently, Babak Nivi, my co-founder, and I were talking  on Twitter about how one gets lucky, and there are really four  kinds of luck we were talking about. The first kind of luck is blind luck where one just gets lucky  because something completely out of their control happened.  This includes fortune, fate, etc. Then, there’ s luck through persistence, hard work, hustle, and  motion. This is when you’re running around creating opportu - nities. You’re generating a lot of energy, you’re doing a lot to stir  things up. It’ s almost like mixing a petri dish or mixing a bunch  of reagents and seeing what combines. You’re just generating  enough force, hustle, and energy for luck to find you. A third way is you become very good at spotting luck. If y ...\n",

But our real fights are mostly\\\\r\\\\ncommonplace, routine battles, where no great victory is ours at the end\\\\r\\\\nof the day. To persist in them requires quiet strength and unfaltering\\\\r\\\\ncourage.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n  Did you ever want to take your two bare hands,\\\\r\\\\n    And choke out of the world your big success?\\\\r\\\\n  Beat, torn fists bleeding, pathways rugged, grand,\\\\r\\\\n    By sheer brute strength and bigness, nothing less?\\\\r\\\\n  So at the last, triumphant, battered, strong,\\\\r\\\\n    You might gaze down on what you choked and beat,\\\\r\\\\n  And say, \"Ah, world, you\\\\\\'ve wrought to do me wrong;\\\\r\\\\n    And thus have I accepted my defeat.\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n  Have you ever dreamed of\\', \\'And thus have I accepted my defeat.\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n  Have you ever dreamed of virile deeds, and vast,\\\\r\\\\n    And then come back from dreams with wobbly knees,\\\\r\\\\n  To find your way (the braver vision past),\\\\r\\\\n    By picking meekly at typewriter keys;\\\\r\\\\n  By bending o\\\\\\'er a ledger, day by day,\\\\r\\\\n    By some machine-like drudging? No great woe\\\\r\\\\n  To grapple with.

If the opposing\\\\r\\\\nteam is formidable, he says so; if his men have their work cut out for\\\\r\\\\nthem, he admits it; but he mentions these things as incitements to\\\\r\\\\neffort.

       "   Message_Chatbot(message='So, like, there\\'s this dude, Edgar A. Guest, and he\\'s like, \"Yo, if you wanna climb a mountain, you gotta bring more than just a pick and a spade, feel me? You gotta come correct with some major mechanical engineering, straight up.\" And I\\'m like, \"Word?\" But then he drops some knowledge about how our willpower is like a power tool – you bring a basic tool, you get a basic result. You bring a beast machine, you get beast mode results.\\n\\nAnd then he\\'s like, \"How y\\'all approach your daily grind? You scared of the work, or you facing it head-on? You feeling those dread vibes, or you out here manifesting that boss energy?\" And I\\'m just like, \"Sheeesh, deep.\" \\'Cause like, it\\'s true, if you ain\\'t feeling yourself, you ain\\'t gonna get far. That\\'s on period.\\n\\nThen this other poet, Miriam Teichner, slides in and starts spitting fire about how we all wanna be St. George, dragon-slaying and whatnot, but in reality, we out here fighting mundane battles, and it\\'s the persistence and courage that matter in those everyday struggles. Like, you might wanna go ham and flex your muscles, but sometimes you gotta chill and let your skills do the talking, whether it\\'s typing on a keyboard or crunching numbers.\\n\\nAnd then Edgar A. Guest comes back with another verse, basically asking if the world got you down, are you gonna let it hold you back, or are you gonna bounce back and climb to success like so many others? It\\'s all about that mindset, ya feel?\\n\\nSo, in conclusion, these poets are basically reminding us that we gotta bring the right tools, physical and mental, to climb our mountains. We gotta believe in ourselves and not be scared of the work. It\\'s all about that positive mindset, and knowing that we can achieve whatever we set our minds to.

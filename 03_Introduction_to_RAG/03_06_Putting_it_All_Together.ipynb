Its not really about hard work. You can work in a restaurant eighty hours a week, and youre not going to get rich. Getting rich is about knowing what to do, who to do it with, and when to do it. It is much more about understanding than purely hard work. Yes, hard work matters, and you cant skimp on it. But it has to be directed in the right way. If you dont know yet what you should work on, the most important thing is to figure it out. You should not grind at a lot of hard work until you figure out what you should be working on. I came up with the principles in my tweetstorm (below) for myself when I was really young, around thirteen or fourteen. Ive been carrying them in my head for thirty years, and Ive been living them. Over time (sadly or fortunately), the thing I got really good at was looking at businesses and figuring out the point of maximum leverage to actually create wealth and capture some of that created wealth. This is exactly what I did my famous tweetstorm about. Of course, every one of these tweets can be extrapolated into an hours worth of conversation. The tweetstorm below is a good starting point. The tweetstorm tries to be information-dense, very concise, high-impact, and timeless. It has all the information and principles, so if you absorb these and you work hard over ten years, youll get what you want.',\n",

COLLECT MENTAL MODELS During decision-making, the brain is a memory prediction machine. A lousy way to do memory prediction is X happened in the past, therefore X will happen in the future. Its too based on specific circumstances. What you want is principles. You want mental models. The best mental models I have found came through evolution, game theory, and Charlie Munger. Charlie Munger is Warren Buffetts partner. Very good investor. He has tons and tons of great mental models. Author and trader Nassim Taleb has great mental models.

      "Luck can play a significant role in achieving success and wealth creation. There are four types of luck: \n",
      "1. Blind luck: This is when something fortunate happens completely out of one's control. \n",
      "2. Luck through persistence and hard work: This involves creating opportunities and stirring things up, generating energy and hustle for luck to find you. \n",
      "3. Spotting luck: Being skilled or attuned to a particular field helps notice lucky breaks that others might miss. \n",
      "4. Unique character, brand, or mindset luck: This is when a person's unique traits or daring endeavours attract luck. \n",
      "\n",
      "Capitalizing on luck can be a skill cultivated by recognizing the different forms luck takes and being open to embracing them. It involves creating opportunities, being sensitive to field-specific lucky breaks, and developing a unique character or mindset that attracts serendipity.\n"

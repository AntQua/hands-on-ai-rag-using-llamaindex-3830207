# Introduction to RAG Evaluation

## Importance of RAG Evaluation

üìè Evaluation gives you concrete numbers that tell you how accurate the system is, how relevant its answers are, and how well it's working overall.

üîç With an evaluation system in place you can compare different models, prompts, and context to figure out what works best.

üìà Regular evaluation will help you assess the quality of your RAG pipeline over time.

Without checking in on how the RAG system is doing, it's tough to know what needs fixing and how to make it better.

## Recall the basic steps in creating a RAG system

 - Create an Index

 - Retrieval relevant context from our Index that are similar to our query

 - Generate responses based on the retrieved context by injecting the retrieved context into a prompt and sending that to an LLM

Take a moment to pause and think about what the two primary components of this system are.

## Evaluating Different RAG Components

A RAG pipeline has two main parts: retrieval and generation.

### **üîç Retrieval component**

This feteches external context from the vector database.

If the retriever makes mistakes, those mistakes will carry over to the generator. So, essential that the retrieved sources are relevant to the user's query.  A good basiss of evaluation is how effective the retrieval is.

You need a way to measure how closely the retrieved context matches what the user is asking about.

### **ü§ñ Generation component**

This combines a prompt template, the user's question, and the context it retrieved to generate an answer using an LLM. 

You want the generated response to be grounded in the retrieved context, relevant to the user's query, and adhere to any guidelines you have in place.

You need a way to measure the relevance of responses to the retrieved context as well as the coherence and fluency of the generated responses.

We need to check how well these components work on their own and 
together.

# Aspects of Evaluation




## Evaluation Metrics

Some key metrics proposed for RAG evaluation include:

- Context relevancy: How relevant the retrieved context is to the question.

- Context recall: Fraction of relevant context chunks retrieved. 

- Faithfulness: How factually correct the answer is based on the retrieved context.

- Answer relevancy: How relevant and complete the generated answer is to the question

Other metrics like ROUGE, BLEU, etc. are also used to compare generated answers to reference answers.


## Challenges and Best Practices

Some key challenges in RAG evaluation include:

- Accounting for retrieval errors that impact generation quality
- Evaluating end-to-end performance vs individual components 
- Relying solely on automatic metrics vs incorporating human evaluation

Best practices involve using a combination of automatic similarity metrics, human evaluation of aspects like relevance and coherence, and a diverse evaluation set covering different question complexities[3].

In summary, a robust RAG evaluation requires carefully measuring the retriever and generator performance, using relevant metrics and datasets representative of real-world usage. Continued research aims to make this complex process more systematic and efficient. Granular evaluation of each component is key to identifying areas for improvement in RAG systems[3][5].

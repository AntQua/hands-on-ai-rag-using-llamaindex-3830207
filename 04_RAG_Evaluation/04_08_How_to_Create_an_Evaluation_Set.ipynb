The trouble of man lies in the love for self. Poverty and peace. - Any poor country or person is hostile while they are down. If you have nothing, you can afford to be hostile. But wait until they, too, become more prosperous. They will soon quiet down and want peace just like the rest of the world. Humility leads to honor. - Humility forms the basis of honor, just as the low ground forms the foundation of a high elevation. The four ethical theories. - There are four different ethical theories: Objective Theory of Ethics - that goodness is objective (Plato's theory) and cannot be further deduced. Consequential Theory of Ethics - that what makes an action good is its outcome (utilitarianism for instance); the most pleasure for the most people (more believable than objectivism as mentioned). Motivational Theory of Ethics - that moral character of an action springs from a motive of the actor - it is not\",\n",

This metaphor implies that humility, by keeping one grounded, prepares and positions a person to rise to honor, much like low ground supports and gives rise to higher elevations. Therefore, the context provides a sufficient basis to answer the question clearly.\\n\\n'},\n",
